Package: tscv
Title: Functions and utilities for tidy time series forecasting and time series cross-validation
Version: 0.1.0
Description: The package tscv provides a collection of functions and tools for time series 
   analysis and forecasting as well as time series cross-validation. This is mainly a set 
   of wrapper and helper functions as well as some extensions for the packages tsibble, 
   fable and fabletools that I find useful for research in the area of time series forecasting.
