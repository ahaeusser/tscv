The package `tscv` provides a collection of functions and tools for time series analysis and forecasting as well as time series cross-validation. This is mainly a set of wrapper and helper functions as well as some extensions for the packages `tsibble`, `fable` and `fabletools` that I find useful for research in the area of time series forecasting.

***Disclaimer:*** The `tscv` package is highly experimental and it is very likely that there will be (substantial) changes in the near future.
